          Education is the manifestation of love and my most cherished
          possession. Education drives away ignorance and through illumination
          it emboldens a man to a righteous thought and action. It empowers a
          woman and enlarges the horizon of her mind. It energizes a society and
          enables a man to earn his living with respect and praise. Hence my
          love for it. I am greatly rejoiced and proudly place on record the
          fact that Selvamm Arts and Science College, the visionary dream of its
          founder Chairman Dr. V.Selvaraj – a humble servant of education whose
          little mission a decade ago to transform a small college into a big
          one, has unfolded into an institution of glorious past and great
          future.

          An administrative or secretarial role can sometimes be a way into
          another profession, particularly those in the media or marketing; that
          is, many professionals in sectors such as marketing and the media
          start out in an administrative role and 'work their way up'.
          Similarly, university students and graduates often do short-term temp
          work as an administrator or secretary via a recruitment agency during
          the holidays or after graduating. This sort of office experience can
          be an asset on a CV. However, if you wish to specialise in an
          administrative role, career progression can come from taking on more
          senior administrative positions; what these are exactly will differ
          according to the organisation. In some, you might become a senior
          administrator or team leader; in others, a personal or executive
          assistant ; in still more, an office manager . It’s also not unknown
          for secretarial and administrative staff to specialise in working for
          organisations in particular sectors: for example, pharmaceuticals or
          law.

          Formal academic qualifications are not always needed, although some
          employers do require you to be educated to a GCSE/standards or A
          level/highers level. A small minority might ask for a degree, in which
          case a degree in English, business, IT or information science may be
          beneficial. Most employers require applicants to have office or
          administrative work experience; relevant experience can be gained
          through temping via recruitment agencies. This, in turn, can lead to
          permanent work. Some organisations ask for the ability to type a
          certain number of words per minute or to have experience in
          audiotyping; however, shorthand is no longer asked for as standard. A
          range of secretarial training courses are available online or via
          further education colleges.
